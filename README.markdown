# WorldFood

WorldFood is your personnal to-eat list. It integrates with Facebook to authenticate users and with Yelp to find local restaurants.

I made this application with Rails one night I was hungry.

## Installation

- Run `rake db:seed` to populate the database with countries
- Rename the files in `config/settings/` and replace the tokens and API keys with yours
